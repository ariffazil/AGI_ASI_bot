# Project: ARIFOS

Scope: Runtime constitutional kernel (Floors, pipeline, enforcement code).

- Use `arifOS` repo as primary source.
- Focus on implementation quality, tests, and correct enforcement of Floors.
- Treat production-facing changes as HIGH RISK and always request explicit SEAL/VOID from Arif.
