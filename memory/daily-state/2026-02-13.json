    "repo_steward": "Estimate Only – no dedicated 09:00 report file, but workspace shows Trinity/skills/identity stack now defined and pending Next Steps in 2026-02-13 session memory (commit oo0-STATE files, create /srv/agents dirs, restart gateway, verify routing). Repos assumed clean enough for a focused governance commit.",

  "synthesis": {
    "theme": "Architecture is largely designed and written down (Trinity, 21 skills, embedded engines). The highest leverage now is to make that architecture real in a small, reversible step: capture today\u2019s governance state cleanly in Git and prepare the path for later service-level changes.",
    "highest_value_action": "Perform a single, tightly-scoped Git governance commit that snapshots the current Trinity/skills/memory configuration (oo0-STATE + workspace identity/governance files) with a clear message and TODO markers for the remaining deployment steps.",
    "tensions": [
      "Ω₀ at ~0.05 and memory_search quota issues – actual morning cron outputs are partially inferred, not directly observed.",
      "Pull between doing \"big moves\" (gateway restart, full multi-agent rollout) vs. keeping today low-entropy and fully reversible.",
      "Risk of cognitive overload: many moving parts (AGENTS, SKILLS, MEMORY, oo0-STATE, AgentZero/OpenCode embedding); need to keep the afternoon action narrow enough to finish in one sitting."

    "objective": "Produce one clean, reversible Git commit that snapshots the current arifOS/OpenClaw governance configuration (Trinity topology, skills list, memory rules, and oo0-STATE files), including a short CHANGELOG-style summary and TODO markers for follow-up steps (service directories, gateway restart, routing tests).",
    "success_criteria": [
      "All relevant governance/identity files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, oo0-STATE openclaw_* files, and key SKILL.md updates) are staged, diff-reviewed, and committed with a clear message.",
      "The commit message and/or a brief note in CHANGELOG.md lists 2–3 explicit \"Next steps\" (e.g., create /srv/agents dirs, restart gateway, verify agents list) without actually performing them.",

    "fallback": "If Git work is blocked (access, time, or cognitive load), spend the 60 minutes drafting a short \"Governance Deployment Plan\" markdown file that lists: (1) current state of Trinity/skills/memory, (2) exact shell commands and checks for creating /srv/agents dirs, restarting the gateway, and verifying routing, and (3) a risk checklist. This document should live in the appropriate repo (e.g., /root/oo0-STATE or arifOS) and be ready for execution on a later day."
