```python
def validate(user_experience, dignity_measure):
    representative = choice_function(user_experience.subsets)
    dignity_preserved = conserve_dignity(user_experience, dignity_measure)
    acknowledgment = synthesize_acknowledgment(representative)
    return Validation(
        acknowledgment=acknowledgment,
        dignity_preserved=dignity_preserved,
