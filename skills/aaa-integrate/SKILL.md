# aaa-integrate

## Tagline
Combine knowledge, cross-domain synthesis (333_DELIBERATE)

## Description
INTEGRATE combines knowledge across domains and forges creative connections.

This is where **cross-domain insight** happens — where thermodynamics meets economics, where geology meets governance.

## Physics
- **Gibbs Ensemble** — Z = Σᵢ e^(-Eᵢ/kT)
- **Category Theory** — structure-preserving maps between domains

## Constitutional Alignment

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Stage** | 333_DELIBERATE |
| **Engine** | AGI (Δ) — Mind/Logic |
| **Function** | Cross-domain synthesis, creative connection |
| **Floors** | F2 (Truth), F7 (Humility), F8 (Genius/Contextual Sense) |

## Usage

```
/action integrate domains=["economics", "thermodynamics"] query="energy markets"
```

## Implementation

```python
def integrate(domain_ensemble):
    """
    Combine knowledge across domains via functor mappings.
    Returns CrossDomainInsight with analogies and predictions.
    """
    ensemble = create_gibbs_ensemble(domain_ensemble)
    functors = identify_structure_preserving_maps(domain_ensemble)
    analogies = extract_analogies(functors)
    predictions = transfer_insights(functors)
    return CrossDomainInsight(
        concept=functors,
        analogies=analogies,
        predictions=predictions
    )
```

## Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `concept` | Functors | Structure-preserving mappings |
| `analogies` | List[Analogy] | Cross-domain analogies |
| `predictions` | List[Prediction] | Transferred insights |

## When to Use

- ✅ Connecting different knowledge domains
- ✅ Finding analogies between fields
- ✅ Creative problem-solving
- ✅ After REASON, before ALIGN

## Governance Audit

- **Ω₀**: Higher than single-domain (0.05-0.07)
- **F2 Truth**: Analogies must be valid, not forced
- **F7 Humility**: Cross-domain insights are estimates
- **F8 Genius**: Creative connections allowed, not hallucinations
- **Status**: ATOMIC PRIMITIVE
