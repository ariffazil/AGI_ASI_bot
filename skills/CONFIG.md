# AGI-bot Entropy Intelligence Configuration

## System Overview
This configuration defines the entropy intelligence framework for the AGI-bot system, implementing arifOS constitutional governance with chaos reduction and cognitive load management.

## Skill Categories

### Atomic Actions (9) - Foundation
Located in: `_organized/atomic/`
- Core constitutional operations based on arifOS metabolic loop
- Immutable foundation for all higher-level operations
- Direct mapping to arifOS stages (000-999)

### Application Skills (5) - Execution
Located in: `_organized/application/`
- Domain-specific implementations
- Built upon atomic action foundations
- Direct user interaction layer

### Meta-Governance (1) - Oversight
Located in: `_organized/meta/`
- System-wide entropy management
- Constitutional compliance verification
- Cognitive load optimization

## Entropy Intelligence Parameters

### Chaos Thresholds
- System Chaos Max: 0.3 (above triggers optimization)
- Cognitive Load Max: 0.5 (above triggers load balancing)
- Constitutional Drift Max: 0.1 (above triggers compliance correction)

### Optimization Protocols
- Continuous Monitoring: Enabled
- Automatic Correction: Enabled
- Manual Override: Available
- Audit Logging: Always Active

## Constitutional Compliance

### Active Floors
- All 13 arifOS floors actively monitored
- Real-time compliance verification
- Violation escalation protocols
- Recovery procedures

### Governance Hierarchy
1. Human Sovereign (Ultimate authority)
2. arifOS Constitutional Framework (Rule engine)
3. Entropy Intelligence (System oversight)
4. Atomic Actions (Foundation layer)
5. Application Skills (Execution layer)

## Operational Modes

### Standard Mode
- Normal operation with continuous monitoring
- Automatic optimization within thresholds

### High-Chaos Mode
- Activated when chaos exceeds 0.3
- Aggressive optimization protocols
- Temporary restriction of non-essential functions

### Compliance Alert Mode
- Activated when constitutional drift exceeds 0.1
- Focus on rule compliance
- Temporary suspension of autonomy

## Security Parameters

### Access Control
- All operations logged with cryptographic hashes
- Authority verification for all actions
- Immutable audit trail maintained

### Integrity Verification
- Gödel lock verification for all operations
- Self-referential integrity checks
- Recursive validation protocols

## Performance Targets

### Entropy Reduction
- Minimum 10% weekly entropy reduction
- Continuous improvement in system organization
- Optimal skill interaction patterns

### Cognitive Load Management
- Maintain load below 0.5 threshold
- Optimize skill utilization patterns
- Prevent resource contention
