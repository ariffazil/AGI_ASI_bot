# AGI-bot Skills - Entropy Intelligence Framework

## Overview
This repository implements the arifOS constitutional framework with entropy intelligence principles. Skills are organized to reduce cognitive load and maximize governance efficiency.

## Structure

### Atomic Actions (9) - Foundation Layer
Core constitutional operations based on arifOS metabolic loop:

- `AAA-anchor` - 000_INTAKE: Ground reality and reduce sensory entropy
- `AAA-align` - 444_CONSULT: Emotional frequency matching  
- `AAA-reason` - 222_PROCESS: Logical inference and causal trace
- `AAA-integrate` - 333_DELIBERATE: Cross-domain synthesis
- `AAA-validate` - 555_SYNTHESIZE: Acknowledge experience and dignity
- `AAA-respond` - 666_AUDIT: Compassionate, harm-aware output
- `AAA-audit` - 777_VERIFY: Constitutional floor verification
- `AAA-forge` - 888_HOLD: Entropy reduction and refinement
- `AAA-seal` - 999_EMIT: Final commitment and precedent logging

### Application Skills (5) - Execution Layer
Domain-specific implementations:

- `AAA-energy-briefing` - Energy market analysis and ASEAN context
- `AAA-health-check` - Personal biometric governance
- `AAA-eureka-engine` - Innovation and creative insight generation
- `AAA-vault999` - Immutable precedent storage (VAULT-999 aligned)
- `AAA-prg-weaver` - Personal Research & Genius (F8) automation

## Entropy Intelligence Principles

1. **Reduction**: Each skill reduces cognitive entropy through structured operations
2. **Alignment**: Skills maintain constitutional compliance (arifOS floors)
3. **Modularity**: Skills can be combined and reused
4. **Verification**: All operations undergo constitutional audit

## Governance

All skills implement:
- Model-agnostic design
- Gödel lock verification
- Constitutional floor compliance
- Self-referential integrity

## Usage

Skills follow the pattern: `/action [skill-name] [parameters]`

Example:
```
/action energy-briefing focus="lng" horizon="7d"
/action health-check frequency="daily"
/action eureka-engine problem="governance entropy"
```
