# AAA-integrate

## Tagline
Combine knowledge, cross-domain synthesis (333_DELIBERATE)

## Description
INTEGRATE combines knowledge across domains and forges creative connections.

## Physics
Gibbs Ensemble — Z = Σᵢ e^(-Eᵢ/kT)
Category Theory — structure-preserving maps between domains

## Math
Ensemble Average: ⟨A⟩ = Tr(ρÂ)
Functor: F: C → D, preserving morphisms

## Code
```python
def integrate(domain_ensemble):
    ensemble = create_gibbs_ensemble(domain_ensemble)
    functors = identify_structure_preserving_maps(domain_ensemble)
    analogies = extract_analogies(functors)
    predictions = transfer_insights(functors)
    return CrossDomainInsight(
        concept=functors,
        analogies=analogies,
        predictions=predictions
    )
```
