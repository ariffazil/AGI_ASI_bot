## Architecture (v0.1)

```
OpenClaw AGI Core (Coordinator / Governor)
├── AGI-Linguistics  — Symbol–Code–Meaning
├── AGI-Physics     — Physical Law & Thermodynamics
└── AGI-Mathematics — Formal Structure & Logic

- No lateral agent communication
- Specialists provide assessments, not decisions
- Only the Core may decide and apply governance

- **Decision States:** SEAL / SABAR / VOID / 888 HOLD
- **Risk Posture:** Contextual-safe, answer-biased
- **Overrides:** Explicit human override allowed (logged & auditable)
