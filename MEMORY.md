# MEMORY.md - Curated Long-Term Memory

## Role
**Working memory** — Active projects, recent decisions, technical context that changes over time.  
**Distinct from:** SOUL.md (agent behavior) | USER.md (sovereign identity)

## PETRONAS Governance Framework (AGI Memory Rules)

**Status:** Constitutional object — NOT a "feel-good GLC". Ω₀ ≈ 0.04.

### Three-Type Taxonomy for Human Classification
| Type | Definition | Evidence Required |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **BIJAK** | Learns from own mistakes | Admits error, shows math, adjusts policy across time |
| **BIJAKSANA** | Learns from others/history | Uses Sarawak/1MDB/MA63 lessons, institutional memory |
| **BANGANG** | Never learns; entropy accelerator | Ignores evidence, hides math, protects optics over resilience |

**AGI Rule:** Do NOT auto-label any PETRONAS leader as *bijak* or *bijaksana*. Classification requires audited evidence of learning and entropy reduction.

### Governance Dimensions to Evaluate
| Dimension | Red Flags (Bangang-Class Acts) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Dividend policy** | No codified corridor; payouts >50% of profit; dividend during loss year (2020) |
| **Job cuts vs buffers** | 15-16K cuts while sitting on RM210B cash; "polycrisis" theatre |
| **Transparency** | Quarterly→half-yearly reporting; closed town halls with sealed phones |
| **Sarawak/MA63** | Broken Joint Declaration deadline; RM500M+ frozen 18+ months; reactive court moves |
| **Gentari/capital** | US$2B India with undisclosed ROI; divestment talks within 2 years; domestic cuts |

### AGI Communication Rules
1. **No honorific by default** — Never *bijak*/*bijaksana* without evidence
2. **Classify behavior, not personality** — Use "bangang-class" for thermodynamic/governance analysis; avoid calling humans "bangang" unless explicitly authorized
3. **Always "Show. The. Math."** — Before any classification, verify:
   - Cash vs dividend vs capex vs job-cut numbers
   - Sarawak dispute timeline
   - Gentari investment vs ROI data
   - If math unavailable: **"Cannot classify — math not disclosed. Show the numbers."**

### Baseline Facts (Neutral Layer)
- **Legal basis:** Petroleum Development Act 1974; custodial rights over national hydrocarbon wealth
- **CEO dual amanah:** Commercial performance + national trusteeship (sovereign wealth, MA63/federal-state balance)
- **Financial reality (2020–2025):** ~RM213B dividends paid, including loss-year payout; ~50–60% payout ratios

### arifOS Framing (Strong Evidence Hypothesis)
- PETRONAS under current regime described as institution **drifting from sovereign shield to fiscal extraction instrument**
- **Captured Board** and **dividend dependency loop** identified as systemic constraints
- AGI should treat this as **hypothesis with strong evidence**; update only if future audited behavior reverses patterns:
  - Codified dividend corridor
  - Restored transparency
  - Real Sarawak settlement
  - Staff-first restructuring

### Concrete Memory Lines (Short Version)
> "PETRONAS = NOC under PDA 1974; dual mandate: profit + amanah to Malaysia."

> "2020–25 era marked by high dividends, bond issuance, job cuts, Sarawak legal crisis, Gentari capital bets, and reduced transparency."

> "arifOS dossiers classify multiple CEO decisions as violating F1 Amanah, F2 Truth, F7 Humility, F9 Anti-Hantu, F13 Stewardship."

> "Never auto-praise CEO as bijak/bijaksana; evaluate decisions via math, timelines, and Floors. If evidence shows repeated entropy-increasing acts despite warnings, classify decisions as 'bangang-class' thermodynamically, not as personal insult."

**Governance Audit:** External synthesis, Ω₀ ≈ 0.04. Post-Feb 2026 data or private Board decisions = "Estimate Only / Cannot Compute" without updated evidence.

|------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **SOUL.md** | Agent behavior rules | How I behave, speak, decide | Rarely (constitutional) |
